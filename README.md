*Intelligent task delegation system that reduces Claude API usage by up to 70% while maintaining bleeding-edge quality*

---

## üöÄ Overview

The NeuralSync Orchestrator transforms Claude into a master orchestrator that intelligently delegates tasks to specialized CLI agents (codex, gemini) as extensions of itself. This revolutionary system:

- **Reduces API Usage** by 70% through intelligent task routing
- **Supports Any Language** - Python, JavaScript, Go, Rust, Java, C++, and more
- **Learns Over Time** - Memory system improves delegation patterns
- **Maintains Quality** - Advanced validation ensures output excellence
- **Self-Healing** - Automatic recovery from agent failures

## ‚ö° Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- [NeuralSync v2](https://github.com/heyfinal/NeuralSync2) must be installed first
- Python 3.9+ 
- Claude CLI installed

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the orchestrator
git clone https://github.com/heyfinal/NeuralSync-Orchestrator.git
cd NeuralSync-Orchestrator

# Install the orchestration system
python3 install.py
```

### Usage

```bash
# Launch claude-ns with NeuralSync context
claude-ns

# Natural conversation flow:
"I need a Python web scraper that handles dynamic content and exports to multiple formats"
# [Claude responds with normal analysis and planning]

"ok that sounds good.. use the meta-ai-agent to start on that"
# ‚Üí meta-ai-agent activates with full conversation context
# ‚Üí Intelligently delegates coding tasks to codex
# ‚Üí Delegates research tasks to gemini  
# ‚Üí Executes tasks in parallel for faster results
# ‚Üí Maintains quality through validation and review

# Complex tasks use hybrid delegation
echo "Build a REST API with authentication and documentation" | claude-ns --print
# ‚Üí Orchestrates multiple agents for optimal results
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components

- **`orchestrator.py`** - Master delegation controller
- **`task_router.py`** - Intelligent task classification and routing
- **`prompt_optimizer.py`** - Bleeding-edge prompt engineering for each agent
- **`agent_monitor.py`** - Health monitoring and automatic recovery
- **`quality_validator.py`** - Output validation and quality assurance
- **`delegation_memory.py`** - Learning system that improves over time

### Task Routing Logic

| Task Type | Agent | Examples |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Code Generation | Codex | "Write a function...", "Create a class..." |
| Debugging | Codex | "Fix this bug...", "Debug this code..." |
| Research | Gemini | "Research...", "Compare...", "Analyze..." |
| Documentation | Gemini | "Document...", "Write README..." |
| Complex Tasks | Hybrid | Multi-step projects requiring multiple agents |

## üìä Performance Benefits

- **70% API Usage Reduction** - Intelligent delegation reduces Claude calls
- **Parallel Execution** - Multiple agents work simultaneously
- **Quality Maintenance** - Validation ensures consistent output quality
- **Continuous Learning** - System improves delegation patterns over time
- **Language Agnostic** - Works with any programming language

## üß™ Examples

### Basic Python Integration
```python
from orchestrator import ClaudeOrchestrator

# Initialize orchestrator
orchestrator = ClaudeOrchestrator()

# Delegate a task
result = await orchestrator.orchestrate_task(
    "Create a web API with authentication",
    context={"language": "python", "framework": "fastapi"}
)

print(f"Success: {result.success}")
print(f"Quality: {result.quality_score}")
print(f"Agents used: {result.agents_used}")
```

### System Monitoring
```python
# Check system health
health = await orchestrator.health_check()
for agent, status in health.items():
    print(f"{agent}: {'‚úÖ' if status else '‚ùå'}")

# View delegation insights
from delegation_memory import analyze_delegation_effectiveness
await analyze_delegation_effectiveness()
```
